Allows Markdown to be enabled in posts, comments and bbPress forums. 


== Description ==
This plug-in allows you to write posts (of any post type) using the Markdown syntax. The plug-in converts the Markdown into HTML prior to saving the post. When editing a post, the plug-in converts
it back into Markdown syntax. 

The plug-in also allows you to enable Markdown in **comments** and **BBPress forums**. In these instances the plug-in adds a toolbar, and preview of the processed Markdown with [Prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) syntax highlighter applied (similiar to that used in the Stack Exchange websites such as [WordPress Stack Exchange](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/)).

WP-Markdown stores the processed HTML, so deactivating the plug-in will not affect your posts, comments or bbPress forums.


== Installation ==

Installation is standard and straight forward. 

1. Upload `markdown` folder (and all it's contents!) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to your Settings > Writing page and enable markdown for the appropriate post types and comments.
